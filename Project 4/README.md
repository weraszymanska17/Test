# üìä Men's Fashion Brand Performance Analysis (Insight BI)

## üß≠ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales, discount, and profitability performance across multiple men‚Äôs fashion brands.  
Using **Azure SQL Database** for data storage, **SQL** for cleaning, and **Power BI** for visualization, the goal was to identify which brands are driving the most value through discounts, sales volume, and profit margins.

The dashboard ‚Äî **Insight BI: Men‚Äôs Collection** ‚Äî provides a consolidated, interactive view of top and bottom-performing brands, enabling data-driven decision-making for merchandising and pricing strategies.

## üß† Business Problem

The retail fashion industry operates in a competitive market where understanding brand performance is essential for optimizing pricing and profitability.  
The business wanted to answer:

- Which brands offer the highest discounts and does it impact profit margins?  
- Which brands generate the highest average sales prices?  
- Which brands have the greatest product variety, and how does that relate to performance?  
- What are the least profitable brands, and how can pricing strategy be improved?



## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales transaction details for men‚Äôs fashion products, including:

| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `Brand` | Brand name |
| `Title` | Product desctiption |
| `Original Price` | Initial listed price before discount |
| `Sales Price` | Final selling price |

Before analysis, data cleaning was performed to remove invalid symbols (e.g., ‚Äú?‚Äù) and ensure numeric consistency in price columns.


## ‚öôÔ∏è End-to-End Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
   - Created a **Free Azure SQL Database**.
   - Imported raw product and sales data into Azure.
### 2. Data Cleaning (SQL)
   - Replaced invalid characters (`?`) with blanks in price columns.
   - Trimmed whitespace and standardized text.
### 3. Data Connection
   - Connected Power BI directly to Azure SQL Database using both ‚ÄúDatabase‚Äù and ‚ÄúMicrosoft Account‚Äù options.
### 4. Data Transformation (Power BI)
   - Created new DAX measures:
     - `Discount %`
     - `Profit %`
     - `Cost Price`
### 5. Visualization
   - Built multi-page dashboard including:
     - **Top 5 Brands by Discount %, Profit %, Sales Price**
     - **Top 5 Brands by Product Variety**
     - **Bottom 5 Brands by Profit %**
   - Used bar, donut, ribbon, and area charts for comparative analysis.
### 6. Deployment
   - Published and shared the dashboard through **Power BI Service** as an app.

## üìà Key Insights   
The analysis of men‚Äôs fashion brands revealed distinct pricing and profitability patterns that shed light on how different strategies impact overall performance.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Discounts and Their Impact on Profit Margins
**The Indian Garage Co.** and **British Club** stand out as the most aggressive discounters, with average discounts exceeding **65%**.  While these strategies drive sales volume and customer engagement, they also compress profit margins. Despite strong discount-driven visibility, neither brand ranks among the top performers in profitability ‚Äî indicating a trade-off between short-term sales boosts and long-term margin stability.

---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ High-Value Brands by Sales Price
When focusing on **average sales price**, luxury and semi-premium labels dominate the leaderboard:  **ARMANI EXCHANGE**, **BROOKS BROTHERS**, **Terra Luna**, and **Scotch & Soda** demonstrate a clear premium strategy. 
These brands manage to sustain strong revenue per unit even with limited discounting ‚Äî suggesting efficient brand positioning, perceived exclusivity, and effective targeting of high-income consumers.

---
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Product Variety and Market Reach
Brands like **The Indian Garage Co.** and **U.S. Polo Assn.** lead in **product variety**, offering a broad assortment across multiple fashion categories. A wide catalog correlates with stronger brand recognition and market share but may also lead to operational complexities and diluted profit margins.  Their strategy focuses on reach and volume ‚Äî effective for visibility but potentially costly without optimization of discount depth and stock rotation.

---
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Least Profitable Brands and Strategic Recommendations
At the lower end of profitability, **The Souled Store**, **ADWYN PETER**, and **Be Active X AG** report minimal or negative profit margins.  These brands likely over-index on discounting or operate in highly competitive price bands with limited brand differentiation.

**Recommended Strategy:**
- Implement **data-driven pricing tiers** to balance discounts and margins.  
- Evaluate **product mix** to focus on best-performing SKUs rather than expanding unprofitable lines.  
- Introduce **targeted promotions** instead of blanket discounts to sustain perceived brand value.
